*****************Angry Charles*****************

Problem Description:

Charles is in his last year of engineering college and is still scared of maths, so he passed on his assignmentto you.

He believes that any integer of the form A^x + B^y makes him angry. So, he gives you an integer array X of size N.

For each X[i], You have to find count of angry integers less than X[i].

Input Format:

The first line of input contains an integer N which denotes the size of array.
The second line of input contains an integer A.
The third line of input contains an integer B.
The fourth line of input contains an integer array X of size N.

Output Format
For each X[i], output the count of angry integers less than X[i] on a new line.

Sample Input:
3
10
3
2 4 11

Sample Output:
0
1
3

Constraints:
1 <=N<= 100000
1 <= A,B <= 1000


Solution:

import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
  public static void main (String[]args)
  {

    int n = 3;
    int A = 10;
    int B = 3;

    int[] arr = new int[]{ 2,4,11 };
    double sum=0.0;
    int ans=0;
    int ctr=0;
    
    int newarr[] = new int[n];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
      {
	        int e = arr[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < e; j++)
	       {
	            for (int k = j; k < e; k++)
	            {
		            sum = Math.pow (A, j) + Math.pow (B, k);
	                ans= (int)sum;
		            
		            if (ans < arr[i])
		            {
		                ctr++;
		            }
	            }
	   }
	   newarr[i] = ctr;
	     System.out.println ("ctr:"+ctr);
	     ctr=0;
      }
      
      for(int v=0;v<newarr.length;v++)
      {
          System.out.println (newarr[v]);
      }
  }
}
